# Core Vocs Handbook
[Core Vocabularies Handbook](https://semiceu.github.io/core-vocs-handbook/public-review/index.html)

Welcome to the SEMIC Core Vocabularies Handbook. This document is designed to guide public administrations in putting Core Vocabularies into practice to achieve semantic interoperability across the EU. It explains the underlying concepts, outlines practical use cases, and provides step-by-step methodologies for implementing data models and mappings.

## Who shall read this Handbook

This book is intended for two main audiences: 1) administrative professionals and legal experts, and 2) technical experts and IT professionals.  
Public administrations involve both legal/administrative experts and technical professionals. While they may not always **"speak the same language"**, they must *work together* to ensure smooth digital transformation. Semantics provides the *common foundation* that allows them to bridge their disciplinary differences and find common ground, *enabling effective collaboration* and thereby contributing to improved public services.  
Each intended audience will gain new insights relevant for their respective roles.

### Administrative Professionals & Legal Experts

Domain experts will, upon reading the handbook:

- Understand the role of semantic interoperability at the EU level.
- Gain insight about how structured data and shared vocabularies enhance legal clarity, data exchange, and cross-border cooperation.
- Gain insights into how interoperability supports public services and reduces administrative burdens.

It is expected that this will facilitate coordination with technical teams to ensure that interoperability initiatives meet both legal and operational requirements and assist the administrative professionals and legal experts in making informed decisions about financing and prioritising IT projects that align with interoperability goals.
### Technical Experts & IT Professionals

The technical experts and IT professionals who design, implement, and maintain the software ecosystem will, upon reading the handbook:

- Learn how to design and implement interoperable systems using Core Vocabularies and semantic data models.
- Understand methodologies for creating, mapping, and integrating semantic data models in public administration systems.
- Be able to apply best practices for data exchange, ensuring consistency and accuracy across different systems.
- Use standardised approaches to enhance data accessibility, transparency, and reuse in line with FAIR principles.

It is expected that this will not only facilitate communication with the domain experts but also further streamline software development conformant to the user specification and, ultimately, benefit the citizens by providing more smoothly functioning digital services.

## Handbook Structure
The handbook is organised into the following sections:

### Introduction
This section introduces what interoperability is, what makes it semantic, and how Core Vocabularies contribute to it.

### Use Cases
Potential use cases are categorised into two groups:
- **Primary Use Cases:** The most common, challenging, and interesting scenarios, thoroughly covered within this handbook.
- **Additional Use Cases:** Brief introductions to other relevant scenarios for brevity.

### Guidelines for Use Case Implementation
This section provides detailed methodologies and instructions, divided into several subsections:

#### How to Create New Data Models
Detailed instructions on designing and implementing new data models.

- How to create new XSD schema: This section provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for designing and implementing an XSD schema

- How to Create a New JSON-LD Context Definition
Step-by-step guidance on generating JSON-LD contexts for data exchange.

#### How to Map Existing Data Models
Exploring challenges and methods for aligning diverse data models without enforcing uniformity.

- Map an Existing Ontology
An explanation of the ontology mapping process—from defining requirements to applying alignments. Examples include mapping Core Vocabularies to Schema.org (with further details available on the SEMIC GitHub repository).

- Map an Existing XSD Schema
Outlines a methodology for XSD schema mapping, covering conceptual mapping, technical mapping, validation, and dissemination of mapping rules.

### Tutorials & Examples for Use Cases
This section provides practical tutorials and examples that illustrate how to apply the use cases described above. These hands-on guides offer step-by-step instructions and real-world scenarios, 
complete with sample data, diagrams, and code snippets where applicable. 
They are designed to help both administrative and technical users understand the complete workflow—from conceptual design to technical implementation.

### Glossary
A comprehensive glossary defines key terms related to semantic data specifications—including application profiles, conceptual models, ontologies, data models, and vocabularies. It clarifies their roles in data interoperability and provides references from the SEMIC Style Guide.
