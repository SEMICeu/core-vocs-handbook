# Core Vocs Handbook
[Core Vocabularies Handbook](https://semiceu.github.io/core-vocs-handbook)
Welcome to the SEMIC Core Vocabularies Handbook. This document is designed to guide public administrations in putting Core Vocabularies into practice to achieve semantic interoperability across the EU. It explains the underlying concepts, outlines practical use cases, and provides step-by-step methodologies for implementing data models and mappings.

## Intended Audience
Public administrations involve both legal/administrative experts and technical professionals. Although these groups may not always "speak the same language," they must work together to ensure smooth digital transformation. Semantics provides the common foundation that enables them to bridge their differences, fostering effective collaboration and improved public services.

This handbook is designed for two primary audiences:

### Administrative Professionals & Legal Experts
- Understand the role of semantic interoperability at the EU level.
- Gain insights into how structured data and shared vocabularies enhance legal clarity, data exchange, and cross-border cooperation.
- Gain insights into how interoperability supports public services and reduces administrative burdens.

### Technical Experts & IT Professionals
- Learn how to implement Core Vocabularies in practical projects.
- Understand methodologies for creating and mapping data models to achieve semantic interoperability.
- Access detailed guidelines to align technical implementations with administrative requirements.

## Handbook Structure
The handbook is organised into the following sections:

### Introduction
This section introduces what interoperability is, what makes it semantic, and how Core Vocabularies contribute to it.

### Use Cases
Potential use cases are categorised into two groups:
- **Primary Use Cases:** The most common, challenging, and interesting scenarios, thoroughly covered within this handbook.
- **Additional Use Cases:** Brief introductions to other relevant scenarios for brevity.

### Guidelines for Use Case Implementation
This section provides detailed methodologies and instructions, divided into several subsections:

#### How to Create New Data Models
Detailed instructions on designing and implementing new data models.

- How to create new XSD schema: This section provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for designing and implementing an XSD schema

- How to Create a New JSON-LD Context Definition
Step-by-step guidance on generating JSON-LD contexts for data exchange.

#### How to Map Existing Data Models
Exploring challenges and methods for aligning diverse data models without enforcing uniformity.

- Map an Existing Ontology
An explanation of the ontology mapping process—from defining requirements to applying alignments. Examples include mapping Core Vocabularies to Schema.org (with further details available on the SEMIC GitHub repository).

- Map an Existing XSD Schema
Outlines a methodology for XSD schema mapping, covering conceptual mapping, technical mapping, validation, and dissemination of mapping rules.

### Tutorials & Examples for Use Cases
This section provides practical tutorials and examples that illustrate how to apply the use cases described above. These hands-on guides offer step-by-step instructions and real-world scenarios, 
complete with sample data, diagrams, and code snippets where applicable. 
They are designed to help both administrative and technical users understand the complete workflow—from conceptual design to technical implementation.

### Glossary
A comprehensive glossary defines key terms related to semantic data specifications—including application profiles, conceptual models, ontologies, data models, and vocabularies. It clarifies their roles in data interoperability and provides references from the SEMIC Style Guide.
