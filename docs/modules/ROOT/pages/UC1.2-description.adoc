*Use Case UC1.2: Create a new JSON-LD context definition*

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Goal:* Create a new standalone JSON-LD context definition that uses terms from Core Vocabularies.

|*Primary Actors:* Semantic Engineer, Software Engineer

|*Description:* The goal is to design and create a new JSON-LD context definition that is not part of a more comprehensive semantic data specification, relying on terms from existing CVs as much as possible. As an information exchange data model, a JSON-LD context definition can be integrated in describing data, building APIs, and other operations involved in information exchange.

|*Example:* Core Person Vocabulary [xref:references.adoc#ref:32[cpv-json-ld]], Core Business Vocabulary [xref:references.adoc#ref:33[cbv-json-ld]]

|*Note:* A detailed methodology to be applied for use cases will be provided in the xref:how-to-create-new-data-models.adoc#sec:create-a-new-json-ld-context-definition[Create a new JSON-LD context definition] section.
