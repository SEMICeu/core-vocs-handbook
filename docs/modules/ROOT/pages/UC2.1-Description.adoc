*Use Case UC2.1: Map an existing Ontology to a Core Vocabulary*

|{set:cellbgcolor: #f5f8fc}
*Goal:* Create a mapping between the terms of an existing ontology and the terms of Core Vocabularies.

|*Primary Actors:* Semantic Engineer

|*Actors:* Domain Expert, Business Analyst, Software Engineer

|*Description:* The goal is to create a formal mapping expressed in Semantic Web terminology (for example using +rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf+, +owl:equivalentClass+, +owl:equivalentProperty, owl:sameAs+ properties), associating the terms in an existing ontology that defines relevant concepts in a given domain, to terms defined in one or more CVs. This activity is usually performed by a semantic engineer based on input received from domain experts and/or business analysts, who can assist with the creation of a conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping associates the terms in an existing ontology, which defines relevant concepts within a specific  domain, to terms defined in one or more SEMIC Core Vocabularies. The result of the formal mapping can be used later by software engineers to build information exchange systems.

*Example:* Mapping Core Person to Schema.org [xref:references.adoc#ref:34[map-cp2org]], Core Business to Schema.org [xref:references.adoc#ref:35[map-cb2org]], etc.
*Note:* A detailed methodology to be applied for this use case will be provided in the xref:how-to-map-existing-data-models.adoc#sec:map-an-existing-ontology[Map an existing Ontology] section.
